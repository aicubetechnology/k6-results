# Comparison Report: H100 vs B200 Performance - Bench Session 009

Date: May 27, 2025

## Overview

This report compares the performance of H100 and B200 servers based on load tests conducted on the three functional endpoints of qube_neural_memory:
- `/memorize`
- `/admin/forget`
- `/admin/tenant/{tenant_id}/stats`

## Hardware Comparison

| Server | GPU | Other Characteristics |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| H100   | 8x NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 | High-end GPU server |
| B200   | None detected | CPU-optimized server |

## Performance Comparison - Load Tests

### Endpoint: `/memorize`

Based on the load tests, the performance difference between H100 and B200 is significant:

| Metric | H100 | B200 | Comparison |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| Average Response Time | ~282.64 ms | ~45.18 ms | B200 is ~6.3x faster |
| p(95) Response Time | ~289.66 ms | ~65.00 ms | B200 is ~4.5x faster |
| Request Rate | ~3.32 req/s | ~11.23 req/s | B200 handles ~3.4x more requests |

### Endpoint: `/admin/forget`

| Metric | H100 | B200 | Comparison |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| Average Response Time | ~272.58 ms | ~10.12 ms | B200 is ~26.9x faster |
| p(95) Response Time | ~272.92 ms | ~35.62 ms | B200 is ~7.7x faster |
| Request Rate | ~0.77 req/s | ~7.38 req/s | B200 handles ~9.6x more requests |

### Endpoint: `/admin/tenant/{tenant_id}/stats`

| Metric | H100 | B200 | Comparison |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| Average Response Time | ~272.50 ms | ~8.46 ms | B200 is ~32.2x faster |
| p(95) Response Time | ~272.84 ms | ~33.36 ms | B200 is ~8.2x faster |
| Request Rate | ~0.77 req/s | ~7.33 req/s | B200 handles ~9.5x more requests |

## Stress Test Issues

The stress tests encountered issues and couldn't be completed. The H100 server appeared to timeout on high load, which suggests potential scalability issues under extreme load.

## Conclusions

1. **Counterintuitive Performance**: Despite having powerful H100 GPUs, the H100 server performed significantly worse than the B200 server, which doesn't appear to have dedicated GPUs.

2. **Consistent Advantage**: The B200 server's performance advantage was consistent across all tested endpoints, with the most dramatic difference in the admin/forget and tenant stats endpoints.

3. **Scalability**: The B200 server demonstrated better scalability during load tests. The H100 server struggled under high load during stress tests.

4. **Potential Explanations**:
   - Configuration issues on the H100 server
   - Inefficient GPU utilization for these specific operations
   - Network or I/O bottlenecks on the H100 server
   - Better CPU or memory configuration on the B200 server
   - Potential optimizations in the B200 implementation

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Investigate configuration of the H100 server
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Consider CPU-optimized servers like B200 for this workload
   - Further optimize the application for GPU utilization if H100 is to be used

## Next Steps

1. Further investigate why the GPU-powered H100 server underperforms compared to the B200 server.
2. Conduct additional tests with different workloads to identify scenarios where H100 might perform better.
3. Analyze resource utilization (CPU, memory, network, GPU) during test execution.
4. Consider application code optimizations to better leverage GPU capabilities.
